# algorithms_for_paper_pairwise_sizes
For a certain set of users of the same social network, thematic communities are defined in which users from the set consist. For each pair of different communities, it is known how many common users from the set are in them.

The received information about the sizes of pairwise intersections of communities is given to the participants of the competition so that they find the original set of users.

The informally described task is closely related to the brain-consciousness problem, since the analog of thematic communities can be mental images, and users can be neurons.

# Problem statement
A set of triples is given, in each of which the first two elements set the names of the sets, and the third element sets the intersection power of two sets with the given names.

It is necessary for each set name to find a set forming intersections of the given powers with other sets.

The first quality indicator is the proportion of pairs of sets (larger â€“ better) in which the intersection cardinality of the sets is observed. The second quality indicator is the power of combining all the found sets (less is better).
